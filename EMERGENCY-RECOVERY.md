# EMERGENCY RECOVERY - APP IS BRICKED

## The Problem
Your package.json has invalid JSON syntax that's preventing npm from working at all. The error is:
```
"@radix-ui/react-dropdown-menu": 
"vite": "^4.5.0","^2.1.3",
```

## Immediate Fix Options

### Option 1: Use Replit's Rollback Feature (RECOMMENDED)
1. Click the "History" button in the left sidebar
2. Find a checkpoint from before the package.json got corrupted
3. Click "Rollback" to restore to that working state
4. This will instantly fix your environment

### Option 2: Manual JSON Fix (if rollback unavailable)
Open package.json in the file editor and find line 30-31, change:
```json
"@radix-ui/react-dropdown-menu": 
"vite": "^4.5.0","^2.1.3",
```
To:
```json
"@radix-ui/react-dropdown-menu": "^2.1.3",
```

### Option 3: Create New Project (Nuclear Option)
If rollback fails:
1. Create a new Replit Node.js project
2. Copy your `server/`, `client/`, `shared/`, and `dist/` folders
3. Use the packager tool to install dependencies fresh

## For Deployment After Recovery
Once your app is working again, use the `server-deploy.js` file I created - it's a self-contained deployment server that avoids all the complexity issues that caused the original deployment failures.

## Why This Happened
The deployment attempts created conflicts between development and production configurations, leading to corrupted package.json syntax.

**Use the rollback feature first - it's the fastest recovery method.**
