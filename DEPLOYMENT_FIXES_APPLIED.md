# Deployment Fixes Applied - Dynamic Require Resolution

## Issues Resolved

### 1. Dynamic Import/Require Errors
**Problem**: `Dynamic require of "path" is not supported in the bundled production code`

**Root Cause**: The server code was using dynamic imports like `import("path")` and `import("fs")` which are not supported in ESM bundles for production deployment.

**Solution Applied**:
- Replaced dynamic imports with static imports in `server/index.ts`
- Added `import path from "path"` and `import fs from "fs"` at the top of the file
- Converted the `setupStaticServing` function from using promises with dynamic imports to synchronous code with static imports

### 2. Build Configuration Issues
**Problem**: Node.js built-in modules were being bundled instead of externalized, causing compatibility issues

**Solution Applied**:
- Updated `build-simple.js` to use `--packages=external` instead of `--packages=bundle`
- Added explicit externalization for all Node.js built-in modules:
  - `path`, `fs`, `crypto`, `os`, `util`, `events`, `stream`, `http`, `https`, `url`, `querystring`, `zlib`, `child_process`
- Externalized all major dependencies to prevent bundling issues:
  - `express`, `@neondatabase/serverless`, `drizzle-orm`, `passport`, `express-session`, `connect-pg-simple`, `multer`, `ws`, `stripe`

### 3. Production Dependencies
**Problem**: Production `package.json` was missing required dependencies

**Solution Applied**:
- Updated production `package.json` in `build-simple.js` to include all necessary dependencies:
  - Database: `@neondatabase/serverless`, `drizzle-orm`
  - Authentication: `passport`, `passport-local`, `express-session`, `connect-pg-simple`
  - File handling: `multer`, `sharp`
  - Payments: `stripe`
  - Other core dependencies: `express`, `ws`, `zod`, `nanoid`

### 4. Environment Variable Issues
**Problem**: Frontend environment variables were not properly defined in the build process

**Solution Applied**:
- Added proper `import.meta.env.VITE_STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY` definition in the esbuild configuration
- Ensured all Vite environment variables are properly substituted during build time

## Build Process Improvements

### Server Build
- Uses esbuild with ESM format
- Externalizes all Node.js built-ins and major dependencies
- Minified with source maps for production
- Target: Node.js 18+

### Frontend Build
- Uses esbuild instead of Vite for production builds
- Proper environment variable substitution
- Minified with source maps
- CSS built with Tailwind CLI

### Static File Serving
- Simplified static file serving without dynamic imports
- Falls back gracefully when build directories are not found
- Supports both development and production build paths

## Deployment Configuration

The deployment process now uses:
1. `node vite-free-build.js` as the build command
2. `NODE_ENV=production REPLIT_DISABLE_PACKAGE_LAYER=true node dist/index.js` as the run command
3. All dependencies properly externalized and included in production package.json

## Testing Results

✅ Build process completes successfully without errors
✅ No dynamic require/import errors in production bundle
✅ Environment variables properly substituted
✅ Static file serving works without dynamic imports
✅ All Node.js built-in modules properly externalized

The deployment should now work without the "Dynamic require of 'path' is not supported" error.
