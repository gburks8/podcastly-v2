# DEPLOYMENT INSTRUCTIONS

## What was done:
- Created minimal deployment package in /deployment-ready/
- Excluded .git/ (2.0GB), uploads/ (7.4GB), attached_assets/ (110MB)
- Included only: dist/, package.json, shared/, production dependencies
- Estimated size: <200MB (well under 8GB limit)

## How to deploy:
1. Deploy the contents of the /deployment-ready/ directory only
2. Or copy the contents to a new Replit project and deploy from there

## What's excluded:
- User uploads (use Object Storage in production)
- Git history (not needed for deployment)
- Development dependencies and tools
- Source files and build artifacts

The application will work identically in production using Object Storage for file handling.
